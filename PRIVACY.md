# Privacy Policy

Headset Harry never stores nor transmits, but does collect the following kinds
of data for immediate local processing and storage in volatile RAM on the
Android device only:
* Incoming SMS
* Incoming MMS
* Incoming e-mail
* Wireless network connected / disconnected
* Calendar events

The following kinds of data are transmitted to <https://fabric.io> and stored for being
able to know what improvements are needed to the app:
* Stack traces from crashes; what lines of code / functions were executed during
the crash. No personally identifiable information is ever part of this data.
This is to be able to give users a crash-free experience.
* The missing translation language every time an app translation is missing.
This is to be able to know which new translations are needed.
* What presenter (Calendar, e-mail, SMS, MMS, Wifi) was used, every time
something is presented to the user.
* The app package name of all apps doing status bar notifications. This is to be
able to determine if there's some other app we should consider supporting.

Optionally, users can at their own initiative send more detailed logs than
outlined above to the developer, via e-mail. These logs will be used solely for
tracking down problems with the app, and never be passed on to any third party.
Other than that they will be handled on a case-by-case basis. Any user with
special requirements should specify so in the e-mail.

Questions about this policy will be answered by <johan.walles@gmail.com>.
